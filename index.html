    <h2 class="head">2021 BMW M440i Coupe</h2>
    <img src="img1.jpg" alt="there was supposed to be an image here" class="img">
    <p>When the BMW M440i Coupe was first released, it was available only with xDrive all-wheel drive. To be honest with you, I never expected there to even be a rear-wheel drive variant, as rear-wheel drive cars from BMW are so seldom bought in the ‘States that it didn’t seem worthwhile to even sell another. However, as I was on my way to return the ALPINA B8 I recently tested, I received a call, telling me there was a rear-wheel drive M440i available for when I arrived, if I wanted to drive it back. Me not being one to turn down a test drive of any car, I naturally agreed.

        Despite my love for testing cars — I will literally test anything, regardless of how exciting or boring it may seem — I did struggle to see the point of testing the M440i sDrive. Reason being is that, due to the comfy and muted nature of the new 4 Series, I couldn’t imagine it being noticeably different in any way from the xDrive model I originally drove, back when it was released. Turns out, I was right. Mostly.

        The BMW M440i sDrive Coupe, mechanically, is nearly identical to the xDrive car, just without a driven axle at the front. That means it uses the same B58 3.0 liter turbocharged inline-six engine — with 48-volt mild-hybrid tech — making 382 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Its straight-six engine is paired with the always excellent eight-speed ZF auto but, this time, it only sends power to the rear wheels.

        As always, BMW’s B58 engine steals the show. It’s such a great overall engine, it wouldn’t be out of line to call it the best six-cylinder engine in the world. I’m not sure there’s an engine on the market that can match the B58’s blend of silky smooth deliver, thrilling performance, growly sound, and affordability (the B58 can be had in very reasonably priced sedans and coupes). It’s flat-out brilliant. However, the addition of the 48-volt mild hybrid system is a bit of hit and miss.
