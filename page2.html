    <h2 class="head">2023 Audi A6 e-tron</h2>
    <img src="img2.jpg" alt="" class="img">
    <p>Audi's busy adding to its roster of e-tron electric vehicles, and the next in line to debut will be the A6 e-tron, a sleek sedan with all of the brand's cutting-edge technology. Audi says it's targeting a driving range of more than 400 miles per charge. The A6 e-tron is powered by two electric motors with one driving each axle, which endows it with all-wheel drive. Also standard will be DC fast-charging capability that Audi claims will enable the car to charge its battery from five percent to 80 percent of capacity in just 25 minutes. Unlike the gasoline-powered A6 sedan, the A6 e-tron hides a hatchback in its sloped rear roofline, which should give buyers a large cargo area similar to that of the current A7. Audi hasn't allowed us a glimpse inside the A6 e-tron yet, but we expect a full roster of infotainment features, luxury-level materials, and enough interior room for four adults to travel comfortably in. We expect the production version of the A6 e-tron to debut in 2022 and go on sale in early 2023.

Audi hasn't released information on pricing for the A6 e-tron yet, but we expect it to be priced competitively with the similarly-sized Tesla Model S. When we find out more about pricing, trims, features, and options, we'll update this story with details.
